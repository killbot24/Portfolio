                        <p class="text-lg leading-7 mb-6 lg:mb-8">Hi, I'm Thomas Burke, and I'm a recent graduate with a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. I'm thrilled to have advanced to stage 2 of the Enterprise Ireland Student Awards, which demonstrates my commitment to pursuing these interests.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-7 mb-6 lg:mb-8">Over the past two years, I've honed my skills as a freelance developer, specializing in Java development and website design. This experience has not only expanded my technical knowledge but has also allowed me to develop critical thinking skills and a strong work ethic.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-7 mb-6 lg:mb-8">What excites me most is the opportunity for continuous learning and personal development. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and bring my enthusiasm and abilities to any project or team. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring how I can help make a positive impact through my work</p>
